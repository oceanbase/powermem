## Codex plugin

The project-context skill tells Codex when to search, remember, revise, retire, delegate, hand off, acknowledge, or
record an outcome. The prompt hook recalls relevant entries and captures user input as Source evidence. MCP tools
perform explicit operations. The plugin never starts or embeds the Server.

## Work continuity

HTTP, the Python Client, and MCP expose Work Contract creation, Handoff preparation and continuation, acknowledgement,
and Task Outcome recording. A Prepared Handoff is temporary; `commit_handoff` creates a durable Revision. An
acknowledgement can select a prepared or exact Handoff, but `handoff_receipt_ref` accepts only an accepted exact Receipt
for a committed Revision. Claims and checks can be `declared` or `verified` with exact same-scope citations. These
records never grant identity, tool, or execution authority.

```text
create_work_contract
  -> work
  -> handoff_current_work
  -> continue_handoff + acknowledge_handoff
  -> record_task_outcome
```

`create_work_contract` records the objective, scope, completion criteria, authority notes, and consequential open
questions for newly delegated work. `handoff_current_work` captures caller-inspected state and returns a temporary
Prepared Handoff; it does not publish a milestone. Call `commit_handoff` separately when the user wants a durable
milestone.

The receiver calls `continue_handoff` with a prepared, exact, or latest selection. When starting from latest, the
returned exact Revision is shown and inspected before acknowledgement. `acknowledge_handoff` accepts prepared or exact,
never latest. It refuses acceptance when any Handoff evidence is unavailable or when live-state, capability, and
authorization are not all `confirmed`. A receiver can instead record `needs_clarification` or `declined`. The receipt
and its three confirmations are untrusted observations; they grant no identity, tool, or execution authority.

`record_task_outcome` preserves `succeeded`, `partial`, `blocked`, `failed`, `cancelled`, or `unknown` and exact check
states. To cover a committed Handoff result, `handoff_receipt_ref` identifies the active accepted exact Receipt; an
unlinked Outcome in the same scope does not cover it. The operation stores a `task-outcome` Source that existing
Experience incubation can inspect, but does not generate or approve an Experience by itself. Integrations call it only
at a real completion or interruption boundary, not solely because a prompt, Stop event, or Session ended.

Claims and checks are either `declared` with no evidence or `verified` with exact same-scope citations. A readable
citation proves identity and availability, not freshness. Current instructions, live workspace state, capabilities,
and authorization still take precedence over all Work and Handoff records.

For the complete Codex transfer and acknowledgement workflow, see
[Hand off work in Codex](../how-to/handoff-with-codex.md).

Handoff Report is a read-only projection over a Scope selection. `all` includes every Scope, `exact` includes only the
listed Scope IDs, and `subtree` includes an organization root and all descendants. Each included Scope contributes its
latest exact Handoff address or an explicit `no_handoff` result; Parent does not imply Context visibility. Codex fixes
ordinary Agent report reads to the current Session Scope. Broader selections belong to host and Dashboard views.
See [Use Handoff Report](../how-to/use-handoff-report.md) for the report UI.

## DeepSeek Harness plugin

The project-context skill tells DeepSeek Harness when to search, remember, revise, or retire Memory. Before each model
step the plugin recalls relevant entries and captures user input as Source evidence. Named `pc_*` tools perform explicit
HTTP operations. The plugin never starts or embeds the Server.

## Pydantic AI adapter

The repository contains a preview Pydantic AI adapter with three Memory tools and automatic bounded
`PreparedContext`. It is not currently available as a supported standalone package. Optional capture stores
redacted, bounded visible model and completed tool events, performs checkpoint Flush, and flushes remaining Sources
after the run. MCP needs no adapter package but does not provide automatic context preparation, capture, or Flush.
See [Pydantic AI adapter preview](../how-to/configure-pydantic-ai.md).

## LangGraph adapter

`powercontext-langgraph` connects a LangGraph graph to a running Server through the public Python Client. It supplies
three components: `powercontext_tools()` returns `BaseTool` instances for model-initiated Memory read and write;
`PowerContextRecall` is a node or `pre_model_hook` that prepends one bounded `PreparedContext` as a system message
labelled untrusted historical evidence; and `PowerContextScope` is a dataclass for the graph `context_schema` that
carries the scope and per-run connection overrides. The recall node and tools read the active scope from the LangGraph
runtime and otherwise fall back to `POWERCONTEXT_LANGGRAPH_*` environment settings.

Scope resolution sends an explicit `scope_id`, when configured, to the Server for validation and otherwise uses the
Server default Scope. The adapter does not derive Scope IDs from Git or process paths. `TOKEN` is a bare token that the
Client composes into `Authorization: Bearer`, unlike the `POWERCONTEXT_*_AUTHORIZATION` header used by the Codex,
Claude Code, and DeepSeek Harness plugins. Recall and the tools fail open: on Server unavailability the graph still
reaches its end and the tools return a short unavailable string. The adapter covers Memory read and write and bounded
recall only; automatic capture, checkpointing, and Handoff are out of scope. The adapter deliberately does not
implement `BaseStore`, whose get, upsert-by-key, and delete operations the Memory model does not provide. It never
starts or embeds the Server.

## LangChain middleware

`PowerContextMiddleware` uses LangChain's `AgentMiddleware` API. It injects one bounded PreparedContext into each
current model request without changing agent state. Automatic capture is disabled by default; pass `auto_capture=True`
to capture the latest user message and final plain-text or structured answer as Content Source evidence after a
successful run. Source-to-Memory activation remains a Server responsibility. Recall and capture fail open, and neither
path starts or embeds the Server. Its source is packaged as `powercontext-langchain`, but it is not currently
published on PyPI. The LangGraph adapter remains a separate node-and-tool integration.

## Pi package

The native Pi package supplies the `project-context` skill, named `pc_*` Memory and Handoff tools, and `/pc`
diagnostics. Before each normal agent start, it requests one strict, bounded PreparedContext value and independently
captures an eligible user prompt as Source evidence. It does not synchronize Pi transcripts. Recall, capture, and
boundary flushing fail open; explicit durable writes require interactive confirmation.

## CLI

Set `POWERCONTEXT_SCOPE_ID` to an existing ID returned by `create_scope` before running scoped content commands.

```text
powercontext setup <host> --source oceanbase/powercontext --ref master
powercontext setup select --host codex --host dsh --source oceanbase/powercontext --ref master
powercontext config init --output .env
powercontext config show --env-file .env
powercontext config validate --env-file .env
powercontext doctor
powercontext doctor <host>
powercontext doctor integrations
powercontext server run
powercontext server run --env-file .env
powercontext ready
powercontext capabilities
powercontext experience generate --scope-id "$POWERCONTEXT_SCOPE_ID" --source-ref content/SOURCE_ID
powercontext skill generate --scope-id "$POWERCONTEXT_SCOPE_ID" --origin experience \
  --artifact-ref experience/EXPERIENCE_ID@REVISION
powercontext skill show --scope-id "$POWERCONTEXT_SCOPE_ID" --revision 1 SKILL_ID
powercontext skill export --target codex --scope-id "$POWERCONTEXT_SCOPE_ID" --revision 1 \
  --destination .agents/skills/example-skill SKILL_ID
powercontext external-skill scan --scope-id "$POWERCONTEXT_SCOPE_ID"
powercontext external-skill list --scope-id "$POWERCONTEXT_SCOPE_ID"
powercontext external-skill resolve --scope-id "$POWERCONTEXT_SCOPE_ID" --fingerprint SHA256 EXTERNAL_SKILL_ID
powercontext external-skill import --scope-id "$POWERCONTEXT_SCOPE_ID" --fingerprint SHA256 \
  --mode import EXTERNAL_SKILL_ID
```

All content commands call the configured Server. The optional `server` role adds `powercontext server run`; it does
not create a second content profile inside the CLI.

The `config` group creates, redacts, and validates an explicit environment file. The CLI never searches for that file
implicitly; pass it to `config show`, `config validate`, or `server run` with `--env-file`. See
[Configuration](configuration.md) for precedence and credential-handling rules.

Use `codex`, `claude-code`, `dsh`, `hermes`, `openclaw`, `opencode`, `pi`, or `workbuddy` for `<host>`.
The first-class catalog used by `setup select` and `doctor integrations` contains every listed host except WorkBuddy.
WorkBuddy remains available through the explicit `setup workbuddy` and `doctor workbuddy` commands.

`powercontext doctor` checks the package and Server without requiring an integration. `powercontext doctor integrations`
prints a read-only matrix for every first-class host; a missing CLI is `missing` and does not fail the command.
Each `powercontext doctor <host>` command still fails when that host CLI is missing. The matrix preserves every
host-specific integration check, including OpenCode's separate `plugin` and `skill` results. DSH checks that
`dump-config` lists `powercontext-dsh`; Pi checks that the CLI lists the PowerContext package.

The `candidate` command group exposes the human Review Inbox. See [Review Candidates](../how-to/review-candidates.md)
for the ordered workflow to list, inspect, revise, approve, or reject Candidates.

Generation and revision commands accept repeatable `--source-ref TYPE/ID` and
`--artifact-ref FAMILY/ID@REVISION` options instead of serialized request files. `--target FAMILY/ID@REVISION`
automatically includes the target in Artifact evidence. Managed Skill revision accepts exactly one of inline
`--instructions` or `--instructions-file`, and `--validation` can be repeated.

## Python Client SDK

`PowerContextClient` is the typed asynchronous HTTP client for a Server-owned deployment. Its request and response
models are exported from `powercontext.http`. Mutation responses include exact citations, which callers pass when a
later request revises, retires, or reads an immutable entry version. See the
[HTTP API lifecycle tutorial](../tutorials/api-quickstart.md) for a runnable client flow.

The Client also exposes `generate_experience`, `propose_experience`, `get_experience`, `generate_skill`,
`propose_skill`, `get_skill`, `scan_external_skills`, `list_external_skills`, `resolve_external_skill`,
`import_external_skill`, and the Candidate Review methods. Review writes require `expected_version`. Approval returns
the exact Experience or managed Skill `result_artifact`; pending and rejected Candidates are not Artifact revisions.

`generate_experience` and `generate_skill` accept caller-selected exact Source and Artifact references. They return
either one pending Candidate or an explicit `no_op`. A replacement includes its exact target in `artifact_refs` and
sets `target`. Managed Skill generation also declares its provenance shape:

- `experience`: at least one approved Experience reference, with optional exact Sources;
- `source`: only exact Source references, including official or human-authored material;
- `usage`: the exact target Skill plus bounded usage Sources.

These generation operations require `POWERCONTEXT_SERVER_INFERENCE_GENERATION_MODEL`. The lower-level `propose_*`
operations remain available for a human or integration that already has complete typed content and exact evidence.
Neither path approves its own Candidate. After Review approval, deterministic `searchable_text` is stored on the
existing generic Artifact head and enters the backend's rebuildable FTS index, making the Experience eligible for
`PreparedContext` recall in the same scope. Pending and rejected Candidates, all managed Skills, and historical
Experience revisions remain excluded.

For the relationship between evidence, Candidate versions, approved Revisions, recall, and export, see
[Experience and Skill lifecycle](../explanation/experience-and-skill-lifecycle.md).

## Scheduled Experience incubation

An integration can capture a completed task as a Content Source with metadata `"kind": "task-outcome"`. When the
Experience schedule is configured, the durable Scheduler scans bounded Source windows and enqueues versioned work.
A fenced Worker asks the configured schema-bound pipeline for reusable situation, action, outcome, and lesson
proposals. Each proposal cites exact Sources and enters the Review Inbox as a pending Experience Candidate.

Experience incubation has its own persisted Source cursor, independent from Memory extraction. Candidate writes,
cursor advancement, and Work success commit together; a generation or write failure leaves the window available for retry. Ordinary
prompt Sources are not Task Outcomes and are ignored by this job.

Scheduling stops at the review boundary. It never approves an Experience, includes pending content in
PreparedContext, derives a managed Skill, exports a Skill for an Agent target, or executes instructions. Skill authoring and
export remain explicit steps after the supporting Experience is approved.
Setup and verification steps are in
[Create and review an Experience](../how-to/create-and-review-experience.md).

## Managed Skill export to Agent targets

A configured generator can produce complete managed Skill content through `generate_skill`; a human or integration
can submit already-complete typed content through `propose_skill`. The proposal contains a name, discovery
description, instructions, validation checks, and exact Source or Artifact lineage. It remains a Candidate until a
reviewer approves the exact Candidate version.

Approval creates an immutable Skill Revision. It does not install the Skill or grant execution authority. To make one
approved Revision available to Codex or Claude Code, export it explicitly into a configured repository, user, or plugin
Skill target. The projection writes `SKILL.md` and `powercontext.json`; the manifest records the Agent kind, exact
Artifact reference and rendered-content hash. It refuses to replace an existing destination, so updates require an
intentional new export rather than a silent overwrite.

Codex can discover a repository-local export under `.agents/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`. The Artifact Revision remains
the content authority; Claude Code uses `.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` for the equivalent project target. Both
directories are host-local projections that can be rebuilt from the same exact Revision.
See [Create and export a managed Skill](../how-to/create-and-export-skill.md) for the procedure.

## External Agent-native Skills

External Skills remain authoritative in their original local packages. With explicitly configured Agent targets, the
Server can scan a scope-local, rebuildable Registry and report name, description, provider, Agent kind, host,
installation scope, locator, and whole-package fingerprint. Exact resolve succeeds only when the same package remains
readable on the configured host and its fingerprint still matches. It never installs a package or falls back to a
different version.

Discovery does not enter Review. An explicit `import_external_skill` request with the exact identity and fingerprint
captures a bounded `SKILL.md` snapshot as Source evidence and asks the configured model for a new managed Skill
Candidate. `mode=import` and `mode=fork` record the caller's intent; both create a new managed identity only after
Review approval and leave the external registration unchanged. Package scripts and assets are not copied into the
managed Artifact.

## Authority and gates

| Surface | Content authority | Model gate | Review gate | Current availability |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| External Agent-native Skill | Original package | No for scan/list/resolve; yes for import/fork | No for discovery; yes after import/fork | Host-local Registry and exact resolve |
| Experience | Exact approved Artifact Revision | Yes for generate/evolve; no for typed `propose` | Yes | Exact read and approved-head FTS recall in PreparedContext |
| Managed Skill | Exact approved Artifact Revision | Yes for generate/evolve/import/fork; no for typed `propose` | Yes | Exact read and explicit Agent projection |
| Agent projection | Its source managed Skill Revision | No | No additional review | Rebuildable Codex or Claude Code host-local copy |

## Core SDK

The base `powercontext` package exports Python protocols and models for applications that own their composition root.
It does not select storage, scheduling, transport, or inference on the application's behalf. Use `builtin` when you
want the supplied SQLite or OceanBase-backed implementation in the same process.

## HTTP and MCP

See [HTTP API](http-api.md) for authentication, curl examples, operation groups, errors, and the complete OpenAPI
contract. The Server publishes a Scalar API reference at `/docs`, its OpenAPI document at `/openapi.json`, readiness at
`/health/ready`, capabilities at `/v1/capabilities`, and Streamable HTTP MCP at `/mcp` by default. The Scalar reference
remains public when bearer authentication is enabled, but the operations it describes retain their normal authentication
requirements. HTTP is the complete application contract. MCP is a curated Agent-facing projection of Source capture,
Memory maintenance, work continuity, scope Handoff Report lookup, and Candidate Review. The five Candidate Review
operations use the same validation, `expected_version` concurrency checks, and approval transaction over HTTP and MCP.
Readiness is `ready` with HTTP 200 when all checks pass, `degraded` with HTTP 200 when only configured inference checks
fail, and `not_ready` with HTTP 503 when the Runtime or database fails. Dependency checks use `ready`, `unavailable`,
`timeout`, or `misconfigured`; an intentionally unbound Runtime reports `not_ready` for the `runtime` check.
Experience and Skill generation, exact reads, external Registry operations, and low-level proposal operations remain
HTTP-only.
`POST /v1/context/prepare` and the matching Python Client method expose final ephemeral `PreparedContext` over HTTP;
the Runtime recalls active Memory and approved Experience heads, owns their shared selection and total output budget,
and intentionally does not project the operation as an MCP tool. The public schema remains
`powercontext.prepared-context.v1`; Experience items carry an exact Artifact reference inside the prepared content.
